# Repository-wide Development Standards

## Code Style

- This is a multi-language repository. When JavaScript is used, prefer TypeScript in strict mode
- 2-space indentation for all file types
- Prefer functional components in React
- Write JSDoc for public APIs

## Commit Strategy

- **Atomic Commits:** Ensure commits are small, focused, and descriptive to enhance the project's documentation through git history.

## Testing

- Testing framework not yet implemented

## Documentation

- Update README.md for all new modules
- Keep ADRs in docs/architecture/decisions
- Generate typedoc for public APIs
- **AI Context Files**: Use AI context files to provide additional context to AI tools. These files should be in the root of the project with additional files on a per-subproject basis in the respective directory. They can include:
  - Project-specific guidelines
  - Code snippets for reference
  - Architectural decisions
  - Any other relevant information for AI tools to understand the project better
