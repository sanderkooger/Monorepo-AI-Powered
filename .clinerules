# Repository-wide Development Standards

## Code Style

- This is a multi-language repository. When JavaScript is used, prefer TypeScript in strict mode
- 2-space indentation for all file types
- Prefer functional components in React
- Write JSDoc for public APIs

## Commit Strategy

- **Atomic Commits:** Ensure commits are small, focused, and descriptive to enhance the project's documentation through git history.

## Testing

- Testing framework not yet implemented

## Documentation

- Update README.md for all new modules
- Keep ADRs in docs/architecture/decisions
- Generate typedoc for public APIs
- **AI Context Files**: Use AI context files to provide additional context to AI tools. These files should be in the root of the project with additional files on a per-subproject basis in the respective directory. They can include:
  - Project-specific guidelines
  - Code snippets for reference
  - Architectural decisions
  - Any other relevant information for AI tools to understand the project better

## Infrastructure

- Terraform changes require:
  - Updated module READMEs
# API Key Storage Note:
Always store API keys in Vault using the following convention:
  kv/REPO_NAME/env/secret-key
For example, the Proxmox API key should be stored at:
  kv/Monorepo-AI-Powered/prod/proxmox-api-key
  - Do not bootstrap production secrets via local scripts; use CI/CD for secret injection.
  - Version compatibility checks
