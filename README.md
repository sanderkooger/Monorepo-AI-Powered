## Vision Statement

A production-ready monorepo platform for multi-language/technology systems with integrated DevOps capabilities, featuring:

- Full-stack application development (Next.js + TypeScript)
- Infrastructure-as-Code (OpenTofu/Ansible)
- Cross-platform component libraries
- End-to-end CI/CD pipelines
- Multi-environment deployment strategies
- Integrated testing frameworks
- Secret management Vault

   - Automated environment provisioning
   - Dependency management
   - Local service orchestration

2. 🚀 **Deployment Strategies**

   - Multi-cloud deployment guides
   - Blue/Green deployment patterns
   - Canary release configurations

3. 🔒 **Security Foundations**
   - Self-hosted HashiCorp Vault integration
   - Infrastructure hardening scripts
   - Compliance as Code templates

### Preferred Way of Working

- **Branching:** For new features, create a branch from the main branch. Use atomic commits within these branches to document changes effectively.
- **Commits:** Ensure commits are small, focused, and descriptive to enhance the project's documentation through git history.

## AI Implementation

- **.clinerules:** Contains repository-wide development standards for code style, testing, documentation, and infrastructure practices. **Use this file to set standards that apply across all projects in the monorepo.**
- **.clinerules-architect:** Specifies architecture-specific rules for design principles, documentation standards, and decision records. **Use this file to define architecture patterns and practices for the architect mode.**
- **AI Context Files:** Use AI context files to provide additional context to AI tools. These files should be in the root of the project with additional files on a per-subproject basis in the respective directory. They can include:
  - Project-specific guidelines
  - Code snippets for reference
  - Architectural decisions
  - Any other relevant information for AI tools to understand the project better

**Usage:**

- **.clinerules:** Use this file to set standards that apply across all projects in the monorepo. **Ensure your code adheres to these standards for consistency and quality.**
- **.clinerules-architect:** Use this file to define architecture patterns and practices for the architect mode. **This helps maintain architectural integrity across the project.**
- **AI Context Files:** Use these files to provide context to AI tools. **Place them in the root of the project with additional files on a per-subproject basis in the respective directory.**
