# Architecture Mode Requirements

## Design Principles

1. Prefer hexagonal architecture for service boundaries
2. Validate infrastructure changes against ADRs
3. Maintain explicit interface contracts between modules

## Decision Records

- Use MADR format for all architectural decisions
- Link decisions to impacted services in AI_CONTEXT.md
- Review quarterly for relevance
