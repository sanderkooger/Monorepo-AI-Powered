# Bring Your Own Vault Architecture Decision Record

## Status
Accepted (2025-04-20)

## Context
The repository requires secure secret management while maintaining flexibility across environments:
- Support diverse deployment scenarios (local development, CI/CD, production)
- Avoid infrastructure lock-in
- Maintain security best practices

## Decision
Implement a Bring Your Own Vault (BYOV) policy with:
1. No embedded Vault installation in repository
2. Documentation of integration patterns
3. Example configurations for common scenarios
4. CI pipeline validation of Vault connectivity

## Consequences
### Positive
- Flexibility for different infrastructure setups
- Clear separation between application and secret management
- Reduced maintenance overhead

### Negative
- Additional setup required for local development
- Developers need basic Vault knowledge

## Compliance
- Aligns with section 3.1 of .clinerules-architect (hexagonal architecture)
- Follows MADR format requirements
- Maintains atomic commit strategy per .clinerules
